**Requires [nuhser_core v3.0.4b](https://github.com/Nuhser/nuhser_core/releases/tag/v3.0.4b "Nuhser_Core") to be installed first!**

With this datapack you can use a compass to see your current position and the direction you're facing in (only in the overworld).

If you hold the compass in your **main hand**, you will see your coordinates.

If you are in the nether, you can put it in your **offhand** to see the coordinates of the last portal entered and the distance to it.
